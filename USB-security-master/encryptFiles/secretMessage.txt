Eau Rouge is one of those mythic corners. All the teams are lined up on that wall,
everybody's watching to see who's going to the left or who's going to carry the
most speed through there; and for the drivers, you all know... you really judge
each other because it's one of those measures of bravery.

Long approach, you come out that hairpin, you make your gear changes, you get up
to speed. You start hugging the pitwall, to try and get as much aerodynamic
benefit from hiding behind the wall. All you're doing, the whole way down, is 
measuring the car, and getting yourself absolutely critically prepared for what's
about to happen, because if you don't rock up to Eau Rouge with a very firm plan 
for what's about to happen, you land in trouble very quickly.

And you go into this enormous compression, and the car behaves quite oddly, because
it fires into this wall of tarmac. It resists, so you end up actually using quite a
lot of steering force. And then it goes to the opposite... to a point as you go over
that crest, where everything lines up.

It's... it's like a dance.
